         Our project for Computer Science this week, is creating a AI bots for this game called Vindinium. 
         Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence programming challenge. You have to take the control of a
         hero using the programming language of your choice. You will fight other AI for a predetermined number
         of turns and the hero with the greatest amount of gold will win. You do not directly play as this bot, 
         but instead, you are writing the code for the AI bot and that bot will fight and play the game for you.
