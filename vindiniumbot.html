    <title>My Vindinium Code</title>

     <p> 
            <br>  Our project for Computer Science this week, is creating a AI bots for this game called Vindinium.  <br>
         Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence programming challenge. You have to take the control of a   <br>
         hero using the programming language of your choice. You will fight other AI for a predetermined number   <br>
         of turns and the hero with the greatest amount of gold will win. You do not directly play as this bot,    <br>
         but instead, you are writing the code for the AI bot and that bot will fight and play the game for you.   <br>
         
            <br>  I learned a lot of really cool and interesting things, like how to get a bot to go to a free mine,  <br>
         and then going to a tavern when the health is low, as well as using things like terminal,  <br>
         which I have never heard of before. Also I learned how and when to use arrays, and the correct way to write  <br>
         them in code. I learned that a lot of Javascript is writen, alothough depoending on what your are writing  <br>
         your code for, is written by using, in this instance, a lot of if an var statements. I think that this  <br>
         project was really cool, and how we got to make our AI bot, and we got to write his code, and see <br>
         how he performs in games, and tweaking and editing the bot, which was really interesting and cool.   <br>
         
           <br>   My bot that I created, actually does pretty well. My bot can take open mines that are closest to him,  <br>
         he can take taverns when his health is low, and he can take other peoples mines. I did not make him super complex,  <br>
         like if another bot is 4 steps away I will attack, or something like that, but he will do the main things to get <br>
         gold, and get to taverns. If someone attacks me, and my health is below 30, my bot will go straight to a tavern, <br>
         replenish his health. I think it works well, because at our last tournament, I got first, and my bot was doing the  <br>
         basic things, and that helped him win. I think I did really awesome with my bot.  <br>
         
             <br> The part of my project that I am most proud of, is that I got my bot to be able to go to taverns, and to be able  <br>
         to take enemy mines. I am most proud of this, because I do not think My bot would do anything, and that I would not work  <br>
         at all, but it actually worked really well, and my bot worked well an did well in the tournament, and I was really proud  <br>
         of my code, and how I did. This project was very fun and a nice ending to the projects that we did this year. <br>
