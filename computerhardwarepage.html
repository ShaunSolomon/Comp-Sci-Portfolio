    <p>We get to learn about all these different types of computers and computer parts and how they work!</p>
    <h2 style="font-size:40px">What is a motherboard and what does it do?</h2> 
    <p>A computer motherboard is like the big part of any system beacause if you don't have it, you do not have a computer. The motherboard also has a(CPU),system memory, expansion slots, power supply unit, audio, and sometimes graphics systems. Some types of motherboards are, 
    <ul> 
        <li><strong>ITX:</strong> The ITX motherboard form factor was developed by VIA Technologies and comes in different form factors.</li>  
        <li><strong>LPX/NLX:</strong>
In an effort to allow computers to take up much less space, a slimline desktop system was designed with a smaller motherboard.</li>  
        <li> <strong>Full AT:</strong>
The full AT motherboard — 12" wide and 11" long — is easily recognized by the fact that it has only a keyboard connector on the back of the motherboard and that it contains no other I/O ports.

    <h2 style="font-size:40px">What is a CPU and what does it do?</h2> 
    <p> CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. A CPU is very important part of a computer. A CPU is a circuit made of silicon. CPU can have a ton of very small transistors on it. The CPU is usually enclosed by a steel plate which allows for better heat distribution. 
    </p> 
   <h4>Types of CPUs</h4>  
   <p> 
   There are two main types of CPUs found in computers today: 32-bit and 64-bit. In addition to this, CPUs can be broken down into types based on the manufacturer and version as well.The AMD Opteron series and Intel Xeon series are two common types of CPUs for servers and some workstation computers.
Some mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, use ARM CPUs. These CPUs are smaller in size, require less power and generate less heat.
   </p>

    <h2 style="font-size:40px">What is RAM and what does it?</h2> 
    <p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory and is used to store data for processing by a computer's CPU. RAM stores the data that are arranged in grids in the binary form of 1's and 0's, and can be accessed and transferred at random to the processor for processing by the system's software.
    </p>
    <h4>Different Types of Ram</h4>
    <p> <strong>SDRAM:</strong>
Almost all systems used to ship with 3.3 volt, 168-pin SDRAM DIMMs. SDRAM is not an extension of older EDO DRAM but a new type of DRAM altogether. SDRAM started out running at 66 MHz, while older fast page mode DRAM and EDO max out at 50 MHz. SDRAM is able to scale to 133 MHz (PC133) officially, and unofficially up to 180MHz or higher. As processors get faster, new generations of memory such as DDR and RDRAM are required to get proper performance. 
    </p>
    <p> <strong>Rambus DRAM</strong>
     RDRAM is a serial memory technology that arrived in three flavors, PC600, PC700, and PC800. PC800 RDRAM has double the maximum throughput of old PC100 SDRAM, but a higher latency. RDRAM designs with multiple channels, such as those in Pentium 4 motherboards, are currently at the top of the heap in memory throughput, especially when paired with PC1066 RDRAM memory.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size:40px">What is a harddrive and what does it do?</h2> 
    <p>A hard disk drive or HDD is a storage device that is used for saving and showing digital information by using rotating disks that have magnetic material on them.Storage is the hard drive’s responsibility. Everything you keep on your computer is on a hard drive. Not just documents, pictures, music, and videos. Your programs, your preferences, even your operating system—they’re all stored on your computer’s hard drive.</p>
    <p>Everything that can be saved on a hard drive is measured in terms of its size.A hard drive is like a scale. It doesn’t know the difference between things that are on it; it only knows their size. But instead of pounds, a hard drive measures things like megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB.)A megabyte is 1 million bytes, a gigabyte is 1 billion bytes, and a terabyte is 1 trillion bytes.</p>

   <h2 style="font-size:40px">What is a power supply and what does it do?</h2> 
   <p>A power supply unit/computer is a power supply unit that maintains cooling to low-voltage power for the inside of a computer.  
  </p>
   <ul><strong>Types of Power Supplies</strong> 
            <li>ATX Power Supplies:
        Power Saving Mode and Sleep Mode are there because of ATX power supplies. When connected with a power supply, ATX support energy modes that give you writing and caching of data while the computer is Hypernation or Sleep Mode.</li>
            <li> ATX Supported Voltages:
ATX power supplies support six voltage settings, which include, +5 volt, -5 volt, +12 volt, -12 volt +5 volt standby, and +3.3 volt. This provides manufactures add-on components with current requirements.</li> 
            <li>Power Saving Modes:
With advances in software and operating systems, so have computer power modes advanced. All modern computers support "Power-Save" or "Sleep" mode. These modes enable you to turn off your computer with software rather than using the power button.</li>

 <h2 style="font-size:40px">How do the different components communicate with one another?</h2> 
    <p>The computer system board is made up of buses which is controlled by two bridges called north bridge and south bridge. There are alot of other components in the system and the communication is carried by different Buses. A bus is a system that transfers data between computer components inside a computer or between computers. A bus can connect several places over the same set of wires. Each bus shows its set of connectors to physically plug devices, cards or cables together. </p>

    <h2 style="font-size:40px">What Are The Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor And What Do They Do?</h2> 
        <p><strong>Keyboard:</strong> A keyboard is an external input device used to type data into some sort of computer system whether it be a mobile device, a personal computer, or another electronic machine. A keyboard usually includes alphabetic, numerical, and common symbols used in everyday communication. Keyboards for personal computers are connected to the machine through serial or USB plugs.</p> 
        <img style="height: 400px"; img src="http://media02.hongkiat.com/cool-pc-keyboards/pc-keyboards-RazerTron.jpg">  
        <p><strong>Mouse:</strong>A mouse typically controls the motion of a pointer in two dimensions in a graphical user interface (GUI). The mouse turns movements of the hand backward and forward, left and right into equivalent electronic signals that in turn are used to move the pointer.The relative movements of the mouse on the surface are applied to the position of the pointer on the screen, which signals the point where actions of the user take place, so that the hand movements are replicated by the pointer.[22] Clicking or hovering (stopping movement while the cursor is within the bounds of an area) can select files, programs or actions from a list of names, or (in graphical interfaces) through small images called "icons" and other elements. For example, a text file might be represented by a picture of a paper notebook, and clicking while the cursor hovers this icon might cause a text editing program to open the file in a window.</p>

    <p><strong>Monitor:</strong>A monitor or a display is an electronic visual display for computers. The monitor comprises the display device, circuitry and an enclosure. Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers were used for entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality.</p>
